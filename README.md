# Melocas-Ire

Development of a platform game called Melocas' Ire with Unity Engine.
Collaboration with three other members during our second semester at EPITA.

The game we created features four playable characters, each with their own unique skills and abilities. Each level is based on a different theme, which adds variety and keeps the game interesting.

Overall, we were able to create a fun and interactive game that we're all proud of. Working with a team was a great experience and I learned a lot about game development and collaboration. I'm excited to share our project on my GitHub and showcase what we were able to accomplish together.
